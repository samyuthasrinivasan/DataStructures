He was after the truth. At least, that's what he told himself.
He believed it, but any rational person on the outside could 
see he was lying to himself. It was apparent he was really 
only after his own truth that he'd already decided and was 
after this truth because the facts didn't line up with the 
truth he wanted. So he continued to tell everyone he was after 
the truth oblivious to the real truth sitting right in front of him.
